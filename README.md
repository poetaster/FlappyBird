# FlappyBird

This is FlappyBird re-implementation of [Godot Engine Tutorial - Flappy Bird](https://bitbucket.org/EdwardAngeles/godot-engine-tutorial-flappy-bird) in godot 3.2
The Tutorial consists of a series of well made videos showing a consistent methodology for building Godot apps. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv3l-oZCXaql20IlPe7gfBEzomnPSLekY

The original re-implementation by  Shivpratap Chauhan was missing some event handling for mobile. This implementation extends the obstacles and ,

This version as of 1.0.3 adds simple high score saving. This is done in the hbox_score_best.gd using simple a simple Resource (in player.gd). I think it's in keeping with the original series of keeping things together and simple.

TODO 
- add adversarie stages.
